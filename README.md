# Some documentation files.

This repository contains an assortment of documentation I've written/gathered
over the years that may prove to be of some use. It serves as a sort of my
little, secure library in the cloud.

Most items will be available in both Open Office (.odt) and Portable Document
(.pdf) formats.

#### Folders
* ANSI - Some documents on ANSI terminal control code sequences.
* misc - As the name implies, this is miscellaneous stuff.
* ps_2 - This folder contains rare documents regarding the old PS/2
interface for keyboard and mouse.

#### Files
* [ASCII 5 ways](ASCII_5_ways.png) -
The first 128 code points formerly called ASCII.
* [Bell Star Codes](Bell Star Codes.pdf) - The various codes used to control phone
features in the Bell Canada system. Most codes are common to other carriers too.
* [Cmd Help](cmdhelp.pdf) - An overview of the options of the Windows standard
CLI processor. Useful when you need to get things done in that operating system.
* [de Morgan](de_morgan.jpg) - In boolean logic, DeMorgan's theorem can be used
to translate an AND gate into its OR gate equivalent. This handy picture (.jpg)
shows the mapping of all eight two input AND gates to their OR gate shadows.
* [A Minitest Cheatsheet](Minitest_Cheatsheet.pdf) - a one page summary of the
Minitest testing framework.
* [Rake Snippets](rake_snippets.md) - A markdown file with little rake tasks
that have proven useful in gem development. Suitable for copy and pasting
(and editing).
* [Rdoc Docs](rdoc_docs.pdf) - I no longer use rdoc, but this is a useful guide
to the interesting world of rdoc command line options.
* [REGEX](REGEX.pdf) - a one page summary of regular expressions derived from
many sources.
* [Ruby Class Summary](Ruby_Class_Summary.jpg) - a picture (.jpg) of the Ruby
Class Hierarchy. By Jerome Dalbert.
* [Ruby Class Summary 2](QC8xj.png) - a nicer picture (.png) of the Ruby
Class Hierarchy. Source unknown.
* [Ruby Comparison Operators](Ruby_Comparison_Operators.png) - an unabashed
snapshot from the Pick Axe book. This little gem is a snippet of Ruby knowledge
I just can't do without.
* [stty options](stty_doc.txt) The command line options for this most
mysterious and enigmatic command.
* [The Reek Cheat Sheet](The_Reek_Cheat_Sheet.txt) - A little guide I put
together to help using Reek.
