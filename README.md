# Some documentation files.

This repository contains an assortment of documentation I've written/gathered
over the years that may prove to be of some use. It serves as a sort of my
little, secure library in the cloud.

Most items will be available in both Open Office (.odt) and Portable Document
(.pdf) formats.

* ASCII_5_ways - The first 128 code points formerly called ASCII.
* de_morgan - In boolean logic, DeMorgan's theorem can be used to translate an
AND gate into its OR gate equivalent. This handy picture (.jpg) shows the
mapping of all eight two input AND gates to their OR gate shadows.
* Minitest_Cheatsheet - a one page summary of the Minitest testing framework.
(Open Office and PDF)
* poker_hands - You gotta know when to hold'em, know when to fold'em, know when
it's OK to sing, know when it's not...
* ps_2 - This folder contains rare documents regarding the old PS/2
interface for keyboard and mouse.
* REGEX - a one page summary of regular expressions derived from many sources.
* Ruby_Class_Summary - a picture (.jpg) of the Ruby Class Hierarchy. By Jerome
Dalbert.
