# Some documentation files.

This repository contains an assortment of documentation I've written/gathered
over the years that may prove to be of some use. It serves as a sort of my
little, secure library in the cloud.

Most items will be available in both Open Office (.odt) and Portable Document
(.pdf) formats.

#### Folders
* misc - As the name inplies, this is miscellaneous stuff.
* ps_2 - This folder contains rare documents regarding the old PS/2
interface for keyboard and mouse.

#### Files
* ASCII_5_ways - The first 128 code points formerly called ASCII.
* cmdhelp - A brief overview of the options available in the Windows standard
CLI processor. Useful when you need to get things done in that operating system.
* de_morgan - In boolean logic, DeMorgan's theorem can be used to translate an
AND gate into its OR gate equivalent. This handy picture (.jpg) shows the
mapping of all eight two input AND gates to their OR gate shadows.
* Minitest_Cheatsheet - a one page summary of the Minitest testing framework.
(Open Office and PDF)
* rake_snippets - A markdown file with little rake tasks that have proven
useful in gem development. Suitable for copy and pasting (and editing).
