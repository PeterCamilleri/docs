# Some documentation files.

This repository contains an assortment of documentation I've written/gathered
over the years that may prove to be of some use. It serves as a sort of my
little, secure library in the cloud.

Most items will be available in both Open Office (.odt) and Portable Document
(.pdf) formats.

#### Folders
* misc - As the name inplies, this is miscellaneous stuff.
* ps_2 - This folder contains rare documents regarding the old PS/2
interface for keyboard and mouse.

#### Files
* [ASCII 5 ways](ASCII_5_ways.png) -
The first 128 code points formerly called ASCII.
* [Cmd Help](cmdhelp.pdf) -
A brief overview of the options available in the Windows standard
CLI processor. Useful when you need to get things done in that operating system.
* [de Morgan](de_morgan.jpg) -
In boolean logic, DeMorgan's theorem can be used to translate an AND gate into
its OR gate equivalent. This handy picture (.jpg) shows the mapping of all
eight two input AND gates to their OR gate shadows.
* [A Minitest Cheatsheet](Minitest_Cheatsheet.pdf) -
a one page summary of the Minitest testing framework.
(Open Office and PDF)
* [rake_snippets](rake_snippets.md) -
A markdown file with little rake tasks that have proven useful in gem
development. Suitable for copy and pasting (and editing).
* [rdoc docs](rdoc_docs.pdf) -
I no longer use rdoc, but this is a useful guide to the interesting world of
rdoc command line options.
* [REGEX](REGEX.pdf) -
a one page summary of regular expressions derived from many sources.
* [Ruby Class Summary](Ruby_Class_Summary.jpg) -
a picture (.jpg) of the Ruby Class Hierarchy. By Jerome Dalbert.
* [Ruby_Comparison_Operators](Ruby_Comparison_Operators.png) -
an unabashed snapshot from the Pick Axe book. This little gem is a snippet of
Ruby knowledge I just can't do without.
* [The Reek Cheat Sheet](The_Reek_Cheat_Sheet.txt) -
A little guide I put together to help using Reek.
