# Some documentation files.

This repository contains an assortment of documentation I've written/gathered
over the years that may prove to be of some use. It serves as a sort of my
little, secure library in the cloud.

Most items will be available in both Open Office (.odt) and Portable Document
(.pdf) formats.

* ASCII_5_ways - The first 128 code points formerly called ASCII.
* REGEX - a one page summary of regular expressions derived from many sources.
* Ruby_Class_Summary - a picture (.jpg) of the Ruby Class Hierarchy. By Jerome
Dalbert.
