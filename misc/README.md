# Some miscellaneous files.

These are some off beat files that are nonetheless useful enough to be
included at some level.

* poker_hands - You gotta know when to hold'em, know when to fold'em, know when
it's OK to sing, know when it's not... These secret to this file is to not let
anyone know you need it. Or better yet, to not need it and let them think that
you do.
* radiation - A handy chart for comprehending the level of risk posed by
various doses of radiation. I like to keep this on hand for when I run into
fear crazed loonies who claim that a single atom of plutonium is lethal.
However: if you're basing safety policy on a PNG graphic file, and things go
horribly wrong, you've only yourself to blame.
