# Some documentation files.

This folder contains documentation on the venerable PS/2 interface for
keyboard and mouse. While these are no doubt obsolete, the information
needs to be preserved, if for no other reason than to understand how things
used to work.

All of these documents were created by Adam Chapweske and are used here in
accordance to the instructions contained in each document.

* The_PS_2_Device_Protocol - This document describes the protocol used by the
PS/2 Keyboard, the PS/2 Mouse, and the AT Keyboard.
* The_PS_2_Keyboard_Interface - This document is a thorough review of all
aspects of the PS/2 and AT keyboards and their interfacing requirements.
* The_PS_2_Mouse_Interface - This document is a thorough review of all
aspects of the PS/2 mice and their interfacing requirements.
